## About Me
I am a Full Stack Developer with 4+ years of experience in building scalable, high-performance enterprise applications using Agile methodologies. My expertise spans both frontend and backend development, designing RESTful APIs, implementing microservices, and architecting cloud-native solutions.
I also bring strong DevOps experience in CI/CD automation, containerization, and deploying applications in cloud environments.
Alongside development, I have hands-on experience in test automation, working with tools and frameworks such as Selenium, Protractor, Jasmine, Karma, Cucumber, and implementing BDD/TDD practices to ensure reliability and quality throughout the software lifecycle.
